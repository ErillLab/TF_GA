- need to create an md file detailing the config parameters and their role
- must print to results the configuration file (for the record)
- save as file also the trace (what's printed at each iteration on screen)
- MAX_SEQUENCES_TO_FIT should have separate values for positive and negative
  datasets. That is, we should be able to control what is the sample size for
  the negative dataset independently of the size of the positive set.
- To deal with uneven pos/neg dataset sample sizes, we should average the
  fitness component of each dataset (i.e. score over positive, score over
  negative) before taking the difference.
- During run:
  It would be ideal to display the node number for the best organism, together
  with its score. Also, the node number (and org # and complexity penalty) for
  the best organism in current iteration.
- A visual representation of the organisms using consensus sequences and 
  connectors in a tree-like structure would work great. Consensus sequences
  could use IUPAC extended code or upper (freq>0.5) lower (freq<0.5) case.

Example:
c0 - c1 - CWGT <-- [IUPAC: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865858/]
   |    |  (mu)14 (sigma)5
   |    |  aCAg <-- [upper/lowercase]
   | c2 - c3 - ATgA
   |    |    | 6 12
   |    |    | TTaa
   |    - TAAt

- Ability to launch multiple runs (and generate results1, results2....) folders
  to exploit multicore CPUs

- inputOrganisms_dataset3_0.json performs worse than inputOrganisms_dataset3_1.json
  on positive_dataset3.fas, even though it makes more "good" CTGT-n8-ACAG matches
  on the positive dataset because its PSSMs are a bit more "relaxed" (realistic).
  this is because such relaxation leads to more binding on the background, which
  suggests that we are not giving enough weight to the connector binding.
  Upgraded Thau to 10.0 and this "fixes" the problem.   

- complexity penalty could increase with the log of the number of iterations    
- Complexity penalty (or rates for simplifier mutation should be scaled by
  Thau; otherwise there is intrinsic reward for many connectors if Thau is
  raised)
