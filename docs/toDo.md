## To Do

- [x] Basic documentation
- [x] Implement GA
- [x] Fitness of an organism
- [x] Independent parameters (+ JSON)
- [x] Increase connector tau
- [x] Check complementary reverse
- [x] Test organisms from file
- [x] Remove nodes -> with a higher probability to remove 
- [x] Complexity penalty (+ prob delete)
- [x] Check energy function
- [x] PSEUDO COUNT ON PWM reduced
- [x] ratio --> diferencia/exponenciacio
- [x] use average fitness of the population organisms to compute complexity
- [x] score(per dataset) -> fitness(organism)
- [x] Effective fitness -> diff scores - complexitat
- [x] complexity as a real parameter
- [ ] Check ETE3 python lib
- [x] Initialize with a solution
- [ ] Implicit Complexity function --> 1+(depthOptima - depth) o 1+(pssmsOptims - pssms)
